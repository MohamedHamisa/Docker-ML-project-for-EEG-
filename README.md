The goal is to quickly and easily build a Docker container to run a machine learning model. We'll use three key files for this setup:

Dockerfile
train.py
inference.py
In the train.py script, EEG data from a CSV file (train.csv) will be ingested and normalized. The script will train two machine learning models using scikit-learn: a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model (clf_lda) and a Neural Networks Multi-layer Perceptron model (clf_NN). After training, the models will be saved.

The inference.py script will then load these saved models to perform batch inference on new EEG data from a CSV file (test.csv). The script will normalize the test data, make predictions using both models, and output the classification accuracy and the predicted results.

EEG, or electroencephalogram, is a method used to record electrical activity in the brain. It measures voltage fluctuations resulting from the activity of neurons and is often used in medical and research settings to study brain functions. Small electrodes are placed on the scalp, and these detect the electrical signals generated by the brain.

EEG is commonly used to diagnose conditions such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, brain injuries, and other neurological conditions. It's also used in research related to cognitive science and brain-computer interfaces. The data collected from an EEG is often analyzed to understand brain activity patterns, and in machine learning applications, it can be used to classify or predict different mental states or neurological events.
